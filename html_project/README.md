I have Utilized the knowledge gained from the [HTML for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6OlAwitnFUubtE93DO-l0vu) tutorial series to build a website for The Little Taco Shop. 

I used the taco emoji from the site: [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/taco/). 

Throughout this project, I fully adhered to the principles of academic honesty.

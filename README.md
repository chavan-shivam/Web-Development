# Web Dvelopment Projects

I'm working on a series of web development projects to strengthen my understanding and practical skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks. These projects serve as hands-on learning tools to implement concepts like responsive design, API integration, animations, and user interaction. By building real-world applications, I aim to deepen my problem-solving abilities, explore new tools and libraries, and improve code structure and maintainability. Each project is a step toward becoming a more confident and efficient web developer. This journey also helps in creating a strong portfolio to showcase my learning, creativity, and technical proficiency in web technologies.
